# Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls
that track the president's
approval](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters
glimpse(approval_polllist)
approval_date <- approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate(enddate = mdy(enddate))

```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval
rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I
want you to plot the net approval for each week in 2022, along with its 95%
confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please
use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended. Your plot should look
something like this:

```{r trump_margins, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "biden_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)

# Prepare data
approval_filtered <- approval_date %>% 
  # Filter for year 2022 
  filter(year(enddate) == 2022) %>% 
  # Calculate net approval rate
  mutate(net_approval_rate = approve - disapprove, 
         # Calculate the survey week with lubridate package
         week_enddate = week(enddate)) %>% 
  # Group by subgroup and week to preprare data for desired plot
  group_by(subgroup, week_enddate) %>% 
  # Calculate confidence interval within the group generated above
  summarise(mean_net = mean(net_approval_rate), 
            sd_net = sd(net_approval_rate), 
            count_net = n(), 
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count_net-1),
            se_net = sd_net / sqrt(count_net), 
            lower_bound = mean_net - se_net * t_critical, 
            upper_bound = mean_net + se_net * t_critical)

# Create plot
ggplot(approval_filtered, aes(x = week_enddate)) + 
  theme_bw() + 
  # Create 1 plot for each subgroup with 3 rows to ensure that they are in desired format
  facet_wrap(~subgroup, nrow = 3) + 
  # Color the space between upper and lower bound
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower_bound, ymax = upper_bound, 
                  # Set color and fill according to subgroup to have different colors per subgroup
                  color = subgroup, fill = subgroup), 
              # Specify linetype for the lower and upper bound and alpha to ensure that lines are above the fill
              linetype = 1, size = 1, alpha=0.2) + 
  # Create a line for the mean
  geom_line(aes(y = mean_net, color = subgroup)) + 
  labs(title = "Biden's Net Approval Ratings in 2022", 
       subtitle = "Weekly Data, Approve - Disapprove, %", 
       y = NULL, 
       x = "Week in 2022") + 
  # Remove legend
  theme(legend.position="none") 
```
