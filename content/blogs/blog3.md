I have done all of my schooling from India. I did my schooling from a lot of different places, I was in a boarding school for 5 years. Post my schooling, I decided to pursue a bachelors in Electrical engineering from India itself. Those 4 years of my life were undoubtedly the best years of my life. Apart from keeping up with a rigorous course curriculum, I made friendships that I am sure will last for a time.
